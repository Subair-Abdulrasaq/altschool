                HTML is a standardized markup language used for creating web
                pages.
              </p>
            </details>
            <p>
              I started learning HTML upon learning about web design and the
              intriguing fact behind the internet.
            </p>

              <p>CSS was invented in 1996 by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos.</p>
              <p>
                CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the
                presentation of a document written in a markup language like
                HTML.
              </p>
            </details>
            <p>
              I started learning CSS after getting comfortable with HTML and
              wanting to make my webpages more visually appealing.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned about different CSS properties and how to use them to
              style my webpages.
            </p>
            <p>I'm currently learning CSS responsive design.</p>
            <p>
              I'm also interested in learning more about CSS frameworks like
              Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS.

              <p>Javascript was invented in 1995 by Brendan Eich.</p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to
                websites.
              </p>
              <p>
                JavaScript is also used for backend development, creating APIs,
                and handling server-side logic.
              </p>
            </details>
            <p>

              HTML and CSS and wanting to make my webpages more interactive.
            </p>
            <p>
              I plan on learning about variables, functions, and control
              structures in Javascript.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also interested in learning more about Javascript frameworks
              like React and Angular.
            </p>
